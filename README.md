# NE_Tree-Rings_Istotopes
Analyses of iWUE, ci and climate trends in NE hemlock Forests.
The analysis comprise  2 scripts: one for climate data and one for tree ring istopes.
It Reads raw 13 C data from 11 sites and calculate iWUE, runs statistical analyses of trends, break points and correlations with climate. It also calculates photosynthesis (farquhar Model) and ci/ca (using the p-model).
